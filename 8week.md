Fuck I don't know why I'm getting teary eyed while writing.

Hey darling, it should be noontime for you? What are you doing? Coding? Eating your late lunch like you usually do? Or grocery shopping? Today would have been our 2nd month but things had to, sadly, end. It has also been 3 weeks since we split. And that night was also the last time that I got to talk to you. I miss you so bad. It hurts.

I don't know what happened. I simply wanted to talk to you about my feelings. That conversation was going well in the beginning but it ended the way it did. I must have said something wrong. Did I say anything that hurt or offended your feelings? I was ready to have an argument which would be our first but you had to let me go like that. I'm still questioning as to why you'd let go so easily? Did you even really love me? I was reassured that you'll stay with me and that you'll do better but after a week you drop the word breaking up. Yeas, breaking up although that was not the specific word you used. Let's not fool each other, you just wanted to get rid of me didn't you and you took the chance to do just that.

I love you, I miss you, but I still feel the anguish in my heart that I'm someone you can just easily let go. That's why I'm having doubts as to whether you really loved me or not. My heart feels hesvy lately. I wish I could tell you these things. The pain everything has caused me. But we're broken now. 

I am writing this in commemoration of what would have been. Please help me get over you.
